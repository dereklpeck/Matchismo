Project 2

Evaluation

I think I deserve 100% on this project because I fulfilled all the requirements, and I had a fun time doing it. Set is a tough game and I got a lot better by programming it. I did my best to adhere to MVC. It was tough and I think my weakest part was writing the feedback to the user “Matched blah blah”. My solution to that was sort of jacky, but it works. I also don’t think I architected my project the best in terms of OOP. I can think of, off the top of my head, at least 3 different ways I would re-architect this project with both games in mind. That being said, they both work and I am satisfied with that for now.

I learned a lot of what to do and what not to do from this project.

As such, my evaluation of my project is as follows:

✔️ Project Builds
✔️ Builds without warnings
✔️ All required tasks are completed correctly
✔️ Code is easy to read
✔️ The code is easy to follow
✔️ The UI is clean
✔️ Assignment is turned in on time

Deserved score: 100%

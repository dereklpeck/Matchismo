Evaluation

I think I deserve 50/50 points because I fulfilled all the requirements and had fun doing so. I tried my best to apply my understanding of MVC and write my project in such a way that it would adhere strictly to MVC. I really like my layout, I think it is slick. I think I got the layout of MVC done, however my implementation may not be the best. I refactored the matching methods to better handle three cards, however the tact that displays the results of your move is where I struggled. I don’t think I came up with the most elegant solution there.

As such, my evaluation of my project is as follows:

✔️ Project Builds
✔️ Builds without warnings
✔️ All required tasks are completed correctly
✔️ Code is easy to read
✔️ The code is easy to follow
✔️ The UI is clean
✔️ Assignment is turned in on time

Deserved score: 100%
